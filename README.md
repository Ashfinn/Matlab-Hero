Each folder contains a MATLAB script that solves the corresponding problem. Below is a brief description of each problem:
They are ordered according to difficulty, so anyone can start from 01 and move up while learning.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MATLAB-Practice-Problems.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd MATLAB-Practice-Problems
   ```
3. Open MATLAB and run the scripts in the respective folders to solve the problems.
