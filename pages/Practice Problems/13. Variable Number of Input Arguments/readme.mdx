# Variable Number of Input Arguments

Write a function called under_age that takes two positive integer scalar arguments: 

`age` that represents someone's age, and 
`limit` that represents an age limit. 

The function returns true if the person is younger than the age limit. If the second argument, limit, is not provided, it defaults to 21. You do not need to check that the inputs are positive integer scalars. The name of the output argument is `too_young`.
