# Corner Case

Write a function called corners that takes a matrix as an input argument and returns four outputs: the elements at its four corners in this order: top_left, top_right, bottom_left and bottom_right. (Note that loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor allowed as we have not covered them yet.) See an example run below:

```
[a, b, c, d] = corners([1 2; 3 4])
a =
     1
b =
     2
c =
     3
d =
     4
```
